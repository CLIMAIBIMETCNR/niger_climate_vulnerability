 # Abstract: 
 
 During the last two decades, the sub-Saharan region has experienced
unusual floods that diversely impacted the region. No official and precise data
regarding flood damage and impacts on the population are available and the
magnitude of events are not easily evaluated. Most previous studies investigated
this new threat using data derived from local media sources or world disaster
databases. The aim of this study was to provide the scientific community and policy
makers with an updated and reliable referenced data source concerning floods in
Niger between 1998 and 2015, at national, regional and sub-regional scale. Reliable
information regarding floods was derived from the national official flood damage
database (ANADIA DB) showing their impact on the country. During the
investigated period, considerable numbers were found (about 4000 settlements and
1.7 million people affected by floods). The analysis also indicates a sudden increase
of flood impacts since 2010. Regions in the south-west (Tillabery, Dosso and CU
Niamey) are the most affected, however this kind of risk involves the whole
country and some particularly vulnerable areas have been identified. A data
modeling comprehensive framework based on remotely sensed rainfall (CHIRPS)
and vegetation index (MODIS NDVI) datasets data along with census data were
used to investigate which variables are mostly able to explain the recent and
sudden Niger flood vulnerability detected at departmental scale. Only a few
statistically significant flood damage models were found (61 out of 297), due
essentially to the non-linearity of the increase in damage time series compared to
environmental and climatic trends. The population increase is the most significant
variable at national level, however at regional and sub-regional scale different
patterns provided evidence to identify local triggers for vulnerability.
